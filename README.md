# Differential Equations Computational Practicum

Task description
1. Given the initial value problem with the ODE of the first order and some
interval.
2. For your own variant of the task implement in your favorite programming
language (e.g. Java, Python, C++, C#, Eiffel...)
- Euler’s method,
- improved Euler’s method,
- Runge-Kutta method
in your own software application.
3. Using this application construct corresponding approximation of the solution of
a given initial value problem (provide the possibility of changing of the initial
conditions).
4. Implement the exact solution of an IVP in your application.
5. Provide data visualization capability (charts plotting) in the user interface of
your application (e.g. using the JavaFX).
6. Investigate the convergence of these numerical methods on different grid
sizes (provide the possibility of changing of the number of grid steps).
7. Compare approximation errors of these methods plotting the corresponding
chart for different grid sizes (provide the possibility of changing of the range of
grid steps).
